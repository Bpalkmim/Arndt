// Script:    Tst-sls-01.script
// Author:    Arndt von Staa
// Date:      09/abr/2007
// Purpose:   Test sequencial IO control
      7 == Declare parameters to be used
     19 == Reset all spaces
     22 == Preserve the number of allocated spaces
     25 == Test c  reate an empty control
     28 == Test illegal access to pointer in empty control
     31 == Try to reuse the index
>>> 1    Line 32  Incorrect command parameters:  =NewSIO           sioNULL
<<< 0    Line 33  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
     35 == Verify empty control
     38 == Destroy empty control
     41 == Test open a file
     45 == Verify read file
     48 == Test read the file
     54 == Destroy control
     57 == Open inexistent file
>>> ERROR:   Could not open inexistent file: ..\testcase\tst-sio-xx.test
     61 == Verify if inexistent file exists
     65 == Verify if existing file exists
     69 == Open existing file
     72 == Verify read file
     75 == Read the file testing line count, line size, GetBufferPointer and untrimmed read
     92 == Test get the file name
     95 == Destroy control
     98 == Test write a file
    109 == Verify the written file
    119 == Test compare file
    122 == Test append line to file
    129 == Test compare unequal files, wrong length
>>> ERROR:   File compare found files of different length
          File A: ..\testcase\tst-sio-01.test
          File B: ..\testcase\written.bak
    132 == Create wrong file
    141 == Test compare unequal file, unequal lines
>>> ERROR:   File compare found unequal lines near line: 2
          File A: ..\testcase\tst-sio-01.test
          File B: ..\testcase\written.bak
    144 == Test Copy file
    148 == Test copy file with blanks in name
    152 == Test delete existing file
>>> 1    Line 154  Could not delete file  Is false, should be true.
<<< 0    Line 155  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
    157 == Test delete non existing file
    160 == Test copy file with incorrect name
>>> ERROR:   Could not open copy source file: ..\testcase\tst-sio-01.xxx
    163 == Test extension extractor
>>> 1    Line 168  Extension should exist. Pointer should not be NULL.
<<< 0    Line 169  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
>>> 1    Line 170  Extension should not exist. Pointer should be NULL.
<<< 0    Line 171  Expected failure or error has been recovered. 
    173 == Verify leakage
